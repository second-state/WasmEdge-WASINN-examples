# Mobilenet example for WASI-NN

This package is a high-level Rust bindings for [wasi-nn] example of Mobilenet.

[wasi-nn]: https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-nn

## Dependencies

This crate depends on the `wasi-nn` in the `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
wasi-nn = "0.4.0"
```

## Build

Compile the application to WebAssembly:

```bash
cargo build --target=wasm32-wasi --release
```

The output WASM file will be at `target/wasm32-wasi/release/wasmedge-wasinn-example-mobilenet.wasm`.

## Run

First download the fixture files with the script:

```bash
./download_mobilenet.sh
```

Users should [install the WasmEdge with WASI-NN OpenVINO backend plug-in](https://wasmedge.org/book/en/write_wasm/rust/wasinn.html#get-wasmedge-with-wasi-nn-plug-in-openvino-backend).

And execute the WASM with the `wasmedge` with OpenVINO supporting:

```bash
wasmedge --dir .:. wasmedge-wasinn-example-mobilenet.wasm mobilenet.xml mobilenet.bin tensor-1x224x224x3-f32.bgr
```

You will get the output:

```bash
