# Chat with `CodeLlama-13B-Instruct` using WASI-NN with GGML Backend

## Requirement

### For macOS (apple silicon)

Install WasmEdge 0.13.4+WASI-NN ggml plugin(Metal enabled on apple silicon) via installer

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install.sh | bash -s -- --plugin wasi_nn-ggml
# After install the wasmedge, you have to activate the environment.
# Assuming you use zsh (the default shell on macOS), you will need to run the following command
source $HOME/.zshenv
```

### For Ubuntu (>= 20.04)

Because we enabled OpenBLAS on Ubuntu, you must install `libopenblas-dev` by `apt update && apt install -y libopenblas-dev`.

Install WasmEdge 0.13.4+WASI-NN ggml plugin(OpenBLAS enabled) via installer

```bash
apt update && apt install -y libopenblas-dev # You may need sudo if the user is not root.
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install.sh | bash -s -- --plugin wasi_nn-ggml
# After install the wasmedge, you have to activate the environment.
# Assuming you use bash (the default shell on Ubuntu), you will need to run the following command
source $HOME/.bashrc
```

### For General Linux

Install WasmEdge 0.13.4+WASI-NN ggml plugin via installer

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install.sh | bash -s -- --plugin wasi_nn-ggml
# After install the wasmedge, you have to activate the environment.
# Assuming you use bash (the default shell on Ubuntu), you will need to run the following command
source $HOME/.bashrc
```

## Prepare WASM application

### (Recommend) Use the pre-built one bundled in this repo

We built a wasm of this example under the folder, check `wasmedge-ggml-codellama.wasm`

### (Optional) Build from source

If you want to do some modifications, you can build from source.

Compile the application to WebAssembly:

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-wasi --release
```

The output WASM file will be at `target/wasm32-wasi/release/`.

```bash
cp target/wasm32-wasi/release/wasmedge-ggml-codellama.wasm ./wasmedge-ggml-codellama.wasm
```

## Get Model

In this example, we are going to use `codellama-13b-instruct.Q4_0.gguf`.

Download llama model:

```bash
curl -LO https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/CodeLlama-13B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/codellama-13b-instruct.Q4_0.gguf
```

## Execute

Execute the WASM with the `wasmedge` using the named model feature to preload large model:

```bash
wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload default:GGML:CPU:codellama-13b-instruct.Q4_0.gguf \
  wasmedge-ggml-codellama.wasm --model-alias default
```

After executing the command, you may need to wait a moment for the input prompt to appear.
You can enter your question once you see the `[USER]:` prompt:

~~~console
[USER]:
convert a String into a std::ffi::CString in Rust
[ASSISTANT]:
In Rust, you can convert a `String` into a `std::ffi::CString` using the `to_cstring` method. Here's an example:
```
use std::ffi::CString;

let s = "Hello, world!";
let c_string = s.to_cstring();
```
This will create a `CString` from the `String` `s` and store it in the `c_string` variable.

Alternatively, you can use the `CString::new` method to create a `CString` from a `String` directly:
```
use std::ffi::CString;

let s = "Hello, world!";
let c_string = CString::new(s);
```
This will create a `CString` from the `String` `s` and store it in the `c_string` variable.

Note that the `to_cstring` method and the `CString::new` method both return a `Result` type, which indicates whether the conversion was successful or not. If the conversion fails, the `Result` will contain an error message.
[USER]:
write a hello-world program in Python
[ASSISTANT]:
Sure! Here is a simple "Hello, World!" program in Python:
```
print("Hello, World!")
```
This program will print the string "Hello, World!" to the console.

Alternatively, you can also use the `print()` function with parentheses to print the string:
```
print("Hello, World!")
```
This will also print the string "Hello, World!" to the console.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

## Errors

- After running `apt update && apt install -y libopenblas-dev`, you may encountered the following error:

  ```bash
  ...
  E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend - open (13: Permission denied)
  E: Unable to acquire the dpkg frontend lock (/var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend), are you root?
  ```

   This indicates that you are not logged in as `root`. Please try installing again using the `sudo` command:

  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y libopenblas-dev
  ```

- After running the `wasmedge` command, you may received the following error:

  ```bash
  [2023-10-02 14:30:31.227] [error] loading failed: invalid path, Code: 0x20
  [2023-10-02 14:30:31.227] [error]     load library failed:libblas.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  [2023-10-02 14:30:31.227] [error] loading failed: invalid path, Code: 0x20
  [2023-10-02 14:30:31.227] [error]     load library failed:libblas.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  unknown option: nn-preload
  ```

  This suggests that your plugin installation was not successful. To resolve this issue, please attempt to install your desired plugin again.

## Parameters

Currently, we support the following parameters:

- `LLAMA_LOG`: Set it to a non-empty value to enable logging.
- `LLAMA_N_CTX`: Set the context size, the same as the `--ctx-size` parameter in llama.cpp (default: 512).
- `LLAMA_N_PREDICT`: Set the number of tokens to predict, the same as the `--n-predict` parameter in llama.cpp (default: 512).

These parameters can be set by adding the following environment variables before the `wasmedge` command:

```bash
LLAMA_LOG=1 LLAMA_N_CTX=2048 LLAMA_N_PREDICT=512 \
wasmedge --dir .:. \
  --nn-preload default:GGML:CPU:codellama-13b-instruct.Q4_0.gguf \
  wasmedge-ggml-codellama.wasm --model-alias default --ctx-size 2048
```
